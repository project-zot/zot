## Reporting a Vulnerability

When a vulnerability is found, please *DO NOT* file a public issue. Instead,
send an email to one of the core [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) and await
acknowledgement *OR* file a [private security issue](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories).
Normally we expect to resolve the issue in 60 days. However should there be an exception
the team will reach out for next steps.
