#  Here we are running two tests:
#  1. run zot with local storage and dedupe disabled, push images, restart zot with dedupe enabled
#  task scheduler will start a dedupe all blobs process at zot startup and it shouldn't interfere with clients.
#  2. run zot with s3 storage and dynamodb and dedupe enabled, push images, restart zot with dedupe false and no cache
#  task scheduler will start a restore all blobs process at zot startup, after it finishes all blobs should be restored to their original state (have content)
