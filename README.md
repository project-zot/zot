# Build and install binary (using host's toolchain)

```
go get -u github.com/anuvu/zot/cmd/zot
```

# Full CI/CD Build

* Build inside a container (preferred)

```
make binary-container
```

* Alternatively, build inside a container using [stacker](https://github.com/anuvu/stacker) (preferred)

```
make binary-stacker
```

* Build using host's toolchain

```
make
```

Build artifacts are in bin/

# Serving

```
bin/zot serve _config-file_
```

Examples of config files are available in [examples/](examples/) dir.

# Container Image

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) in this repo can be used to build a container image
that runs _zot_.

To build the image with ref `zot:latest`:

```
make image
```

Then run the image with your preferred container runtime:

```
# with podman
podman run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/registry:/var/lib/registry zot:latest

# with docker
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/registry:/var/lib/registry zot:latest
```

This will run a registry at http://localhost:5000, storing content at `./registry` 
(bind mounted to `/var/lib/registry` in the container). By default, auth is disabled.

If you wish use custom configuration settings, you can override
the YAML config file located at `/etc/zot/config.yml`:

```
# Example: using a local file "custom-config.yml" that
# listens on port 8080 and uses /tmp/zot for storage root
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/custom-config.yml:/etc/zot/config.yml \
  -v $(pwd)/registry:/tmp/zot \
  zot:latest
```

# CLI

The same zot binary can be used for interacting with any zot server instances.

## Adding a zot server URL

To add a zot server URL with an alias "remote-zot":

```console
$ zot config add remote-zot https://server-example:8080
```

List all configured URLs with their aliases:
```console
$ zot config -l
remote-zot https://server-example:8080
local      http://localhost:8080
```

## Listing images
You can list all images from a server by using its alias specified [in this step](#adding-a-zot-server-url):

```console
$ zot images remote-zot
IMAGE NAME                        TAG                       DIGEST    SIZE
postgres                          9.6.18-alpine             ef27f3e1  14.4MB
postgres                          9.5-alpine                264450a7  14.4MB
busybox                           latest                    414aeb86  707.8KB
```

Or filter the list by an image name:

```console
$ zot images remote-zot -n busybox
IMAGE NAME                        TAG                       DIGEST    SIZE
busybox                           latest                    414aeb86  707.8KB
```

# Ecosystem


## skopeo

[skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) is a tool to work with remote
image repositories.

* Pull Images

```
skopeo copy docker://<zot-server:port>/repo:tag docker://<another-server:port>/repo:tag
```

* Push Images

```
skopeo copy --format=oci docker://<another-server:port>/repo:tag docker://<zot-server:port>/repo:tag
```

## cri-o

[cri-o](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) is a OCI-based Kubernetes container
runtime interface.

Works with "docker://" transport which is the default.

# Instrumentation

Can be used for both dist-spec-only zot & the zot with all extensions enabled

## Node Exporter
The dist-spec-only zot exposes internal metrics into a Prometheus format through a node exporter.
The configuration of node exporter contains connection details for the zot server it is intend to scrape metrics from.

```
bin/zot-exporter config _config-file_
```

## Enable Metrics
In the zot with all extensions case see [configuration example](./examples/config-metrics.json) for enabling metrics

# Caveats

* go 1.12+
* The OCI distribution spec is still WIP, and we try to keep up
